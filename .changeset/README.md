# Changesets

This repo uses [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) for versioning and releases.

- Create a changeset: `pnpm changeset`
- Apply changesets to bump versions locally: `pnpm changeset version`
- Publish (CI only): `pnpm release`

See `RELEASE.md` at the repo root for the full workflow.
